# PID-Controlled-BiCopter
Project Name: VTOL UAV Inspired by V-22 Osprey

**Description:**

Welcome to our VTOL UAV project, where we draw inspiration from the iconic V-22 Osprey to create an innovative aircraft. We aim to design a Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) UAV capable of transitioning between helicopter-like vertical flight and fixed-wing mode for enhanced speed and efficiency.

**Challenges tackled:**

Unique Design: Our UAV features a novel tiltrotor design, mirroring the V-22 Osprey's capabilities.<br>
Our project is currently in progress and nearing completion. VTOL UAVs have a multitude of potential applications, from surveillance to cargo delivery. We invite you to join us on this exciting journey and stay tuned for further updates on our UAV's development.<be>
